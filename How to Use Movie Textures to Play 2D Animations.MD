##Introduction
For our project we wanted to have 2D animations play during our Start and Restart screen. We thought that simply importing them would do the trick. This proved to not be the case since it was not a keyframed animation, but a mp4 I had made from Photoshop. For those of who want moving animations in your unity games, this is how. 

##Step One: Make the Animation
Draw an animation in software such as Photoshop or make a Render a 3D animation using After Effects. The animation MUST be a .mov file since the script used in this tutorial does NOT support other files. Photoshop renders animations out as .mp4's but you can use any pnline sources to change the file.
