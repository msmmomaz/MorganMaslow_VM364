#Game Jam 2016 
<p>This past weekend I spent a grand 48 hours participating in Northeastern's Global Game Jam.

##What is Game Jam?
For those who don't know, Global Game Jam is a global event where people at sites world wide come together in order to complete a game in 48 hours. This is not limited to game designers, but includes writers, artists, sound designers, and even cheerleaders for those lacking experience, but not lacking spirit. I attended this years event in an artistic.</p>
<p>Every year a theme is chosen to help narrow down game ideas. Every game must center around the theme. This year's theme was: </p>
######RITUAL
<p>The game we developed based off this theme was: Idle Idol. It was a puzzle game based around the core mechanic of fetch questing. The base story was there was an idol who was trapping a business man (the player) in an alternate dimension. The goal was to complete various tasks the idol presented you with in order to escape. </p>

<p>For this game I was one of the 3D artists. I made most of the small props as well as one of the larger props: the cubicle. I also designed the set, with aid of the puzzle deisgners, and created it in maya. Since this was my second year particpating, I also aided in production organization.

Similarly to last year, we did not complete the game in time. However, I had a good experience and would definitely reccommend it to any others aspiring to join the game industry. I definitely will be attending next year as well.
