#Collaborative Code Project

##About our Project
We'll be creating a website featuring easy-use-infographics about the treatment of women in the media. We'll compare statistics regarding women in media, and look a the intersectionality in these portrayals. Such as how a white woman is treated in a TV show versus a woman of color. We'd also look at sexuality, neurodiversity, and disability.
