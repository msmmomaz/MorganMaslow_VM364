##About our Project
We'll be creating a website featuring easy-use-infographics about the treatment of women in the media. We'll compare statistics regarding women in media, and look a the intersectionality in these portrayals. Such as how a white woman is treated in a TV show versus a woman of color. We'd also look at sexuality, neurodiversity, and disability.

##Problem Domain 
Our problem involves the current treatment of women in the media. We want to see what kind of tropes women of color and LGBT women fall into in TV and movies.

##Technical Challenges 
We are not familiar with Javascript, which we plan to use to make our website functional and clean-looking, so that may be an issue. Another challenge may be getting regex functions to scrape the information we're looking for.

##Potential Solutions 
We will teach ourselves javascript, so we can utilize our early work in programs like textwrangler to create functions. We will also use regex for some of our statistics, although we will look at other sources when needed.
