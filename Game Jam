#Game Jam 2016
	
	
	
	During the weekend of the 29th of January , I spent 48 hours attempting to complete a game. For those who don’t know, Game Jam is a world wide event where artists and programmer come together to  make a game. The game has to be based on the annual theme, and can be digital, live action, or any other type of game. This years theme was: ritual.
	This is my second consecutive year attending. I teamed up with some strangers and few old friends and we planned to make a digital game called: Idol Idle. The main mechanic of our game was escape the room. It would be a puzzle game centered around a bored office worker who becomes trapped in an alternate dimension by an idol and must complete various tasks in order to please him. The tasks ranged from making coffee, to prank calling co-workers, to destroying computers to retrieve hidden files. 
	This year I mostly assisted on the artistic side. I made and textured most of the 3D models. Since I was the second most experienced in my group, I also helped organize ideas and keep people on schedule. I did the main set design and construction, and constructed some props, such as bamboo, and the cubicles. 
	Just like last year, I was not able to complete the game in time. However, the group and I still keep in touch and have decided to continue pursuing its completion. I intend to also continue to attend game jams as long as I remain in places where a site is near by.
